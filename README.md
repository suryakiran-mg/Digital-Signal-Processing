# Samples and Statistics

## Lot sampling to estimate the probability that a lot will be rejected

## Simulation of arrival of cars on a highway. Simulation of the same scenario using equivalent poisson distribution by using the inverse transform method.
 - Histogram with theoretical pmf overlaid
 
## Simulation of a Random Variable (= the smallest number of uniform random samples whose sum is greater than 4) for different counts. Analysis-comparison

## Mean and var of a Sequence eqt to spinning the minute hand on a clock and observing a given stopping position

## Sampling by accept-reject from a uniform auxilliary distribution. Comparisons, efficiency estimates
